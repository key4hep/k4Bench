"""
Render one PR-blame comment from **real EOS data** and, optionally, post it to a
*different* pull request so it can be reviewed in place before the bot is pointed
at the repository it really names.

This is a previewing tool, not part of the nightly job. It answers a single
question — "what would the bot post on pull request X for the regression window
attributed to it?" — using the report and blame sidecar already on WebEOS, the
same cross-configuration review the nightly ``blame_comment`` step runs, and the
same renderer. The one thing it changes is *where* the finished comment lands:
``--post-to`` redirects the upsert to a test pull request while the body is left
exactly as it was rendered for ``--only`` — so the comment on the test PR reads,
links and cross-references as though it were posted on the real one. The bot, in
other words, *thinks* it is commenting on ``--only``; only the write target moves.

Everything downstream of the data source is production code:

* :func:`k4bench.blame.comment.select` decides the target is comment-worthy
  (allowlisted repo, merged, ranked, at or above the threshold) from the real
  sidecar — nothing here lowers that bar;
* :func:`k4bench.blame.comment.build_comments` runs the real
  :mod:`k4bench.blame.attribute` review, configured by the same ``K4BENCH_LLM_*``
  environment as the nightly job, over the real candidates' diffs;
* :func:`k4bench.blame.publish.publish` performs the upsert, so a re-run edits the
  comment it already placed on the test PR rather than stacking a second one.

Because it exercises the real review, it needs the same secrets the nightly job
does: ``K4BENCH_LLM_URL`` / ``K4BENCH_LLM_MODEL`` / ``K4BENCH_LLM_API_KEY`` for
the review — without them the run *fails* rather than silently previewing a
comment production would not post, unless ``--ranker-only`` asks for exactly that
fallback — and ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` (``--read-token``) to fetch the candidates'
diffs.

**Writing is opt-in twice.** A run without ``--post`` renders and logs the
comment and writes nothing, whatever tokens happen to be in the environment;
``--post`` additionally requires an explicit ``--post-to OWNER/REPO#N`` and a
``K4BENCH_PR_COMMENT_TOKEN`` (``--token``) carrying ``pull-requests: write`` on
the **``--post-to`` repository**, not on the one the comment names. There is no
default write target: the one irreversible thing this tool does lands in someone
else's pull request, and it is always named out loud.

The defaults reproduce the worked example this tool was written for — the
detector-dimension change in ``key4hep/k4geo#607``, whose 2026-06-24 → 2026-06-25
window a detector-removal sweep confirmed across 318 configurations. Point
``--night`` / ``--only`` elsewhere for any other window.
