"""
Comment on the pull requests tonight's blame sidecar holds responsible.

Thin CLI over :mod:`k4bench.blame.comment` (which decides what is said, and to
whom) and :mod:`k4bench.blame.publish` (which writes it): reads the already-built
``report.json`` and its ``blame.json``, and for every confirmed regression whose
change window is attributed to a merged pull request at or above the configured
likelihood, upserts one comment on that pull request.

Each selected pull request is then reviewed once against its *whole* window
(:mod:`k4bench.blame.attribute`) — the cross-configuration question the nightly
per-configuration ranker is never asked. That pass needs the candidates' diffs,
which is what the read-only ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` below is for, and it is configured
by the same ``K4BENCH_LLM_*`` environment as the ranker. With no model
configured it simply does not run, and the comments render from the
per-configuration scores in ``blame.json`` alone.

Runs last in the nightly job and is best-effort throughout: it is the only step
that writes outside this repository, so it must never be able to affect the
report, the sidecar, or the e-group email. Most nights it does nothing at all —
most nights have no confirmed regression, let alone a confidently attributed one.

Which repositories may be commented in, and how confident the ranker must be,
come from ``.github/blame-comments.yml`` (``--config``); a repository is added
to that allowlist by pull request, and an empty one makes the bot inert.
The config is parsed here rather than in the package for the same reason
``.github/benchmarks/*.yml`` is: the ``k4bench`` package stays free of a YAML
dependency, and every knob crosses the boundary as plain values.

Writing needs a token carrying ``pull-requests: write`` on the allowlisted
repositories — ``K4BENCH_PR_COMMENT_TOKEN``, deliberately *not* the workflow's
built-in ``GITHUB_TOKEN``, which is read-only and scoped to k4Bench alone.
Without it (or with ``--dry-run``) the rendered comments are logged and nothing
is written, which is how a new repository is checked before it is enabled.
The two tokens stay apart on purpose: reading diffs is an ordinary public-repo
read, and the write token is never spent on one.
