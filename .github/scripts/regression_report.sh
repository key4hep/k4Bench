# Builds the nightly regression report from the EOS run history, uploads it to
# EOS ({EOS_ROOT}/_reports/{YYYY-MM-DD}/report.json, read back by the
# dashboard's Regressions tab) and emails the CERN e-group when the report is
# alertable. Runs after every benchmark job of the nightly workflow — also on
# partial failures, so a crashed detector job surfaces as a FAILURE verdict
# (via its missing run) instead of vanishing.
#
# Required env vars (set by the workflow):
#   K4BENCH_DATA_URL              — WebEOS base URL of the benchmark data
#   X509_USER_CERT, X509_USER_KEY — EOS service certificate paths
#   GITHUB_RUN_URL                — link back to this Actions run
# Optional:
#   K4BENCH_REGRESSION_EGROUP     — e-group recipient (email skipped when empty)
#   K4BENCH_REGRESSION_FROM       — sender address    (email skipped when empty)
#   K4BENCH_DASHBOARD_URL         — dashboard link used in the email body
#   GITHUB_TOKEN                  — enables PR resolution for blame.json (5000/hr)
#   K4BENCH_LLM_URL               — OpenAI-compatible base URL of an *off-box*
#                                   endpoint (e.g. https://openrouter.ai/api/v1);
#                                   enables model-based ranking of blame.json's
#                                   candidate PRs. Unset ⇒ candidates unranked.
#   K4BENCH_LLM_MODEL             — model id at that endpoint (both required to rank)
#   K4BENCH_LLM_API_KEY           — bearer token for the endpoint (kept in secrets)
#   K4BENCH_LLM_MAX_TOKENS        — optional initial completion-token budget;
#                                   length truncation grows it up to a safe cap
#   K4BENCH_LLM_SUMMARY_MODEL     — optional model id for the PR comments'
#                                   cross-configuration review only (step 5c);
#                                   defaults to K4BENCH_LLM_MODEL
#   K4BENCH_BLAME_TIMEOUT         — wall-clock limit for the isolated blame
#                                   step (default: 15m; GNU timeout syntax)
#   K4BENCH_PR_COMMENT_TOKEN      — token with pull-requests:write on the repos
#                                   listed in .github/blame-comments.yml; enables
#                                   the PR comments. Unset ⇒ they are only logged
#   K4BENCH_PR_COMMENT_DRY_RUN    — non-empty ⇒ log the comments, post nothing
#   K4BENCH_PR_COMMENT_TIMEOUT    — wall-clock limit for the comment step
#                                   (default: 15m — the step reviews each
#                                   selected PR against its whole window, so it
#                                   makes model calls of its own)

# night left on EOS is removed — report.json was just replaced above, and a
# stale sidecar must not be joined to a report it never examined. Reuses the
# report build's run cache for provenance (no re-download); GITHUB_TOKEN
# enables PR resolution, and K4BENCH_LLM_* (if set) ranks the candidates via an
# *off-box* hosted endpoint — never local inference on this benchmark runner,
