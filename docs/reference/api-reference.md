# API reference

k4Bench is a small, importable Python package. This page is the entry point to
the auto-generated reference — the pages under it are built from the live
docstrings and type hints by [mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/),
so they never drift from the code.

!!! tip "Docstring quality is doc quality"
    Because these pages render the source docstrings directly, improving a
    docstring improves the docs.

## How to import

```python
# High-level orchestration
from k4bench.benchmark.ddsim import BenchmarkConfig, SweepMode, run_sweep

# Results
from k4bench.results.model import RunResult

# Geometry
from k4bench.geometry.scanner import get_detector_names, resolve_includes
from k4bench.geometry.patcher import patched_geometry, patched_geometry_keep_only

# Analysis (the most common public surface)
from k4bench.analysis import (
    load_results, load_event_timing, load_region_timing,
    plot_run_overview, plot_event_timing, plot_event_memory, plot_region_timing,
)
```

## Stability

The functions and dataclasses listed above are the intended public API.
Underscore-prefixed names are internal, may change without notice, and are
excluded from these generated pages. The project is young and evolving, so even
the public surface may shift between releases — pin a version if you depend on
it programmatically.
