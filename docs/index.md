# k4Bench

**Detector-agnostic performance benchmarking for DD4hep / Geant4 (`ddsim`)
simulations in the [Key4hep](https://key4hep.github.io/key4hep-doc/) stack.**

k4Bench answers a deceptively hard question: *when you run a detector
simulation, where do the seconds and the megabytes actually go?* It runs
`ddsim` under controlled, instrumented conditions and attributes cost down to
the level of an individual subdetector — without you editing a geometry file or
recompiling Geant4.

## What problem does it solve?

Detector simulation is one of the most CPU-hungry steps in an HEP software
chain. As geometries grow and Key4hep releases march forward, two questions
recur:

1. **Which subdetector dominates the runtime / memory?** Answering this by hand
   means hacking copies of the geometry XML, which is error-prone and easy to
   get subtly wrong (orphaned plugins, broken include paths).
2. **Did a Key4hep release make things slower?** Spotting regressions needs
   reproducible measurements collected the same way over time.

k4Bench automates both. It scans a DD4hep geometry, *patches it in memory* to
add or remove detectors, times each configuration with `/usr/bin/time -v` plus
optional in-process Geant4 instrumentation, and emits machine-readable results
that feed a historical dashboard.

!!! info "Scope today, and where it's heading"
    k4Bench currently benchmarks **simulation** (`ddsim`). The framework is
    written to be general — geometry handling, the runner, the result model,
    and the analysis layer are not simulation-specific — and is intended to
    widen to **reconstruction** in the future. Likewise, nothing is tied to
    FCC-ee: any DD4hep compact geometry works. ALLEGRO, IDEA, CLD and the
    FCC-ee-adapted ILD (`ILD_FCCee`) simply happen to be the examples used
    throughout these docs and in nightly CI, alongside DD4hep's own SiD
    reference detector.

and the implementation version under [Architecture](architecture/overview.md).

## A 30-second taste

```bash
# Inside the Key4hep environment, with k4bench installed:
k4bench --xml $K4GEO/FCCee/ALLEGRO/compact/ALLEGRO_o1_v03/ALLEGRO_o1_v03.xml \
        --sweep \
        --events 100 \
        --ddsim-args="--enableGun --gun.particle e- --gun.distribution uniform"
```

This runs the full geometry once as a baseline, then once more for every
subdetector with that detector removed, and prints a table sorted by run:

```text
