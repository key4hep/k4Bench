"""Integration test: every external http(s) link in the repo's user-facing
text still resolves.

Scans README.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, mkdocs.yml, docs/**/*.md, and
dashboard/**/*.py for http(s) URLs and checks each one with a live request.
Catches the class of bug fixed in dashboard/ui_chrome.py's SiD source link
and mkdocs.yml's favicon: a repo/branch/path that got renamed or deleted
upstream, silently turning a link dead.

Requires network access. Skips (rather than fails) if the runner is offline,
same pattern as the ddsim/K4GEO skip in test_simulation.py.
