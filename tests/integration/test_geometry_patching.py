"""Integration test: patch every detector of every real benchmark geometry.

The unit tests cover the patcher's behaviour on synthetic geometries. This one
runs it over the geometries the nightly actually benchmarks, for *every*
detector, through both patch paths — the case that matters, and the one that
caught the redirect bug the synthetic fixtures were too flat to expose (a
detector whose owning file is a nested include, so no include in the top-level
file resolves to it).

No simulation is involved: this checks the produced XML only, so it is cheap
enough to run over a few hundred detectors.

The oracle is an independent expansion of the geometry. ``_expand`` recursively
inlines every resolvable DD4hep document reference in document order and emits
a canonical token per node, so graph structure and the patcher's path
absolutization are normalised away. Removing detector *D* is correct exactly when

    _expand(patched)  ==  _expand(baseline, skipping D)

which is stronger than checking a detector-name list: it also catches content
that went missing, arrived twice, or moved.

Requires $K4GEO (and $DD4hepINSTALL for SiD). Run with: pytest -m integration
