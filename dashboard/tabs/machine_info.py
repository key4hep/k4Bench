"""Machine Info tab — hardware / OS details and machine-condition trends.

The **Current Run** view summarises the host that executed the selected run,
led by an at-a-glance "run quality" band and then grouped into bordered cards
(CPU · Memory · System Load · Environment) so the many individual readings read
as structured sections rather than one flat wall of metrics.

The **Historical Trends** view (remote mode only) plots how the machine's load,
available memory and *measured* contention varied across nightly releases,
making it obvious when a run landed on a day the host was under heavy load.

Reliability model
-----------------
The **Run reliability** verdict is a conservative pass/fail check (see
:mod:`k4bench.results.reliability`): its job is not to score performance on a
continuous scale but to detect runs that were *likely* contaminated by
environmental interference and should be excluded from comparisons. A run is
reliable only when every hard criterion (CPU efficiency, system load, swap
activity, thermal throttling) passes or has no data to judge it; any single hard
failure rejects it, and missing data never rejects a run.

Load is expressed everywhere as a percentage of **physical cores**, matching the
verdict: 100% means the run-queue is as deep as the core count, leaving no idle
core for the single-threaded benchmark — the cutoff above which a run is rejected.

The **Historical Trends** view marks each reliability threshold with a single red
dashed line and shades the unreliable region light red, so it is obvious at a
glance which past releases would be rejected: the 100% load cutoff, the 95%
CPU-efficiency floor, and the 10× context-switch baseline.
