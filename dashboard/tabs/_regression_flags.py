"""Shared regression-flag widgets for the report-backed views.

The Overview, Run Trends, Regressions and Stack Changes tabs all present the
nightly detector's verdicts: ringed nights on trend lines, and the flagged
ledger table. Keeping the marker specs, the pills control, the worst-first
ordering and the ledger here means every tab reads identically — same
colours, same shapes, same wording — instead of drifting apart in
hand-maintained copies. (It is also the dependency-safe home: the tab modules
import each other in one direction only, so a helper shared *across* them has
to live below them all.)

The verdict *severities* themselves come from the precomputed nightly reports
(``_reports/{date}/report.json``); this module only draws them.
