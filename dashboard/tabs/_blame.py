"""Blame-window overlay for a confirmed regression's drill-down chart.

A ``CONFIRMED`` verdict carries the release window the step entered in —
``onset_*`` and ``last_accepted_*``, written by :mod:`k4bench.regression.engine`
and documented on :class:`~k4bench.regression.models.MetricVerdict`. This module
turns that pair into what the reader sees: a shaded band on the drill-down
spanning the window.

Every "does this verdict have a window, and of what shape?" question routes
through :func:`classify`, so the band and the caller's gate both read one
interpretation rather than re-deriving it. Reports written before onset
tracking carry ``None`` and classify as :attr:`WindowKind.NONE`; the caller then
keeps its pre-existing behaviour.
