"""Overview tab — cross-detector comparison of the nightly benchmarks.

Compares every detector's baseline benchmark for the sidebar-selected platform
and sample, over the sidebar's shared Trend window, in four views:
**Performance Trends** (the two selected metrics' history), **Performance
Landscape** (time against memory, one point per detector at its own most recent
run — independent of which report night is open), **Regression Status** (one
report night's verdict banner, the per-detector roster, and the worst flag's
trend — the Regressions tab itself is scoped to one detector, so this is where
the cross-detector regression picture lives; the night is selectable and
defaults to the newest), and **Nightly Report** (that night's e-group mail
itself, see :mod:`tabs._nightly_email`).
The data comes from the precomputed ``_reports/{date}/report.json`` files on
EOS, whose verdicts carry the raw nightly value of every run/event metric for
**all** detectors — one small cached JSON fetch per night, no per-detector run
downloads.

Only the first three views are scoped to the sidebar's platform/sample; the mail
is the whole night, across every scope, so it stays readable even when the
selected scope has nothing (see :func:`render`).

    shared Trend window (``None`` only when the sidebar hasn't resolved one
    yet, e.g. a mid-edit custom range) — in that case
    :func:`nights_in_window` falls back to the latest
    :data:`_FALLBACK_NIGHTS`. It carries no detector scope: its preset resolves
    against the nightly report nights as well as the selected detector's runs

    when the sidebar detector changes rather than sliding to that detector's
    last run and dropping the more recently benchmarked detectors off the
    charts. The window sets which report nights are fetched,
    and so how far back the Regression Status and Nightly Report pickers reach;
    the landscape reads whichever of them measured each detector last, plus the
    nights of any detector whose last run predates the window's end (see
