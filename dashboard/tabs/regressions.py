"""Regressions tab — one night's regression report for the sidebar's scope.

Scoped, like the trend views, by the sidebar's detector/platform/sample
selection: the tab renders the matching run group from the precomputed
``_reports/{date}/report.json`` written to EOS by the nightly
``regression-report`` CI job (see ``k4bench/regression/``). The sidebar's
*release* selects which report nights are on offer (see
:func:`_candidate_nights`): several nights routinely re-benchmark one fixed
nightly, and the engine judges them all against the same frozen baseline, so
a confirmed regression repeats on every night of the release that trips —
though nights can still differ (WATCH → CONFIRMED progression, marginal OK
nights, pre-backfill reports). The default night is therefore the most
attention-worthy one, a picker exposes the release's other nights, and
``?report=`` pins one directly (the deep link emitted in alert emails). The
cross-detector at-a-glance picture lives in the Overview tab. Only the trend
preview downloads run data, and only for the series being inspected.
