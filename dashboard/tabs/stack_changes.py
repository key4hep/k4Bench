"""Stack Changes tab — what moved in Key4hep between two nightlies.

The package diff is cross-detector: a Key4hep release is one stack, sourced
identically by every detector benchmarked against it, so only the platform
scopes it. Which detector supplied the answer is an implementation detail —
the tab reads whichever run it finds first. The *reverse* view below the diff
(the regressions whose onset falls in the range) is scoped to the sidebar's
detector and sample like every other judged view, with a toggle to widen it
back to the whole platform.

The comparison is between **releases**, never run dates. The nightly build
lags: on a day with no new nightly the benchmark sources the newest one
available, so consecutive run dates routinely share one identical stack — most
of the run dates on EOS are not release dates at all. Comparing run dates would
manufacture changes that never happened.
