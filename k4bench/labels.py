"""Shared contracts and human labels for benchmark-run identifiers.

A run carries machine strings for its configuration, detector, EOS sample
directory (``p8_ee_Zbb_ecm91``) and LCG/Spack platform triplet
(``x86_64-almalinux9-gcc14.2.0-opt``). This module owns the stable configuration
vocabulary and turns the latter two scope identifiers into something a person
reads.

It lives at the top level, and depends on nothing, because its consumers sit in
different layers and must not import each other: the benchmark writes these
identifiers, the e-group email and dashboard display them, and the blame ranker
puts them in the prompt a model judges with (:mod:`k4bench.blame.rank`). That
last consumer is why the vocabulary below is behaviour, not styling — widening
:data:`_PARTICLE_LABELS` changes what the model is told is being simulated, so
it is versioned and tested here rather than tweaked as presentation.

Every function degrades to the raw string when a name does not match a known
layout: an unrecognized future sample reads plainly instead of being guessed
at and rendered as garbled physics.
