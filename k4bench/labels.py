"""Human labels for the identifiers that name a benchmark run.

A run is identified by three machine strings — a detector name, an EOS sample
directory (``p8_ee_Zbb_ecm91``) and an LCG/Spack platform triplet
(``x86_64-almalinux9-gcc14.2.0-opt``). This module turns the latter two into
something a person reads, and is the single place that knows their layouts.

It lives at the top level, and depends on nothing, because its three consumers
sit in different layers and must not import each other: the e-group email and
the dashboard *display* these labels, while the blame ranker puts them in the
prompt a model judges with (:mod:`k4bench.blame.rank`). That last consumer is
why the vocabulary below is behaviour, not styling — widening
:data:`_PARTICLE_LABELS` changes what the model is told is being simulated, so
it is versioned and tested here rather than tweaked as presentation.

Every function degrades to the raw string when a name does not match a known
layout: an unrecognized future sample reads plainly instead of being guessed
at and rendered as garbled physics.
