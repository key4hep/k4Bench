"""Shared rendering primitives for the nightly regression report and the JSON
artifact the dashboard reads back (``_reports/{date}/report.json``).

This module owns two things:

* the human-label helpers the dashboard *and* the email both draw with —
  severity badges, metric/sample/platform prettifiers, the dashboard deep-link
  builder;
* the ``to_json``/``from_json`` round-trip for the EOS artifact.

The e-group email body (subject, "Needs attention", ranked candidate cards and
the bounded detailed report) is rendered by :mod:`k4bench.regression.email`,
which imports the helpers below. Keeping the JSON renderer and the dashboard's
imports here — stable — while the email evolves separately is deliberate: the
email is redesigned often, the on-disk report schema almost never.

Ordering vocabulary shared everywhere: hard failures first, then confirmed
regressions (any direction — "regression" here means any confirmed step beyond
the baseline, not just a bad one; none of this is judged good or bad), then a
short WATCH/OK summary — never a row per OK metric.
