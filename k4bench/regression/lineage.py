"""How platforms relate to each other over a migration.

Two independent facts, deliberately kept apart: which platform a young one may
seed its baseline from, and when a platform stops being expected to run. A
predecessor is not necessarily retired — a future migration may keep both
compilers running in parallel — so neither map may be inferred from the other.

Regression history is scoped to ``(detector, platform, sample)`` and stays that
way — a platform is an identity, not a label for "the current one". The cost is
a cold start: a new platform's first
:data:`~k4bench.regression.engine.MIN_BASELINE_RUNS` nights have no baseline to
be judged against.

A platform may therefore name a *predecessor* whose settled level it borrows as
baseline points only, while it has too few of its own. One-way and one hop; the
new platform keeps its own directory, metadata, provenance and history, and no
verdict is ever issued for a borrowed point.
