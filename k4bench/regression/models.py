    re-measure one release. Anything correlating a verdict with the software
    stack must key on ``run_date``.

    ``onset_*`` and ``last_accepted_*`` bound the window a ``CONFIRMED`` change

    two-strike rule, so the night a change is *reported* is one reliable night
    after the night it first *appeared*: ``onset_*`` identifies that first

    that change out — one within baseline variation, or one that tripped the
    opposite way and so sat even further from the changed level. The change
    therefore landed in ``(last_accepted, onset]`` — the interval to search for
