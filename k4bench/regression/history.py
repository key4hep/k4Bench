"""Release-level history tails for the metrics the report confirms.

A confirmed step is one number — "+21%" — and a number on its own cannot be
told apart from the series it came out of. A metric that holds ±0.4% for two
weeks and then moves 21% has almost certainly been changed by something; a
metric that swings 20% every third release has not said anything at all. The
verdict carries the step; this module carries the series, so whoever has to
explain the step (the blame ranker, a human reading the dashboard) can see both.

The unit is the **release**, matching :mod:`k4bench.regression.engine`: nights
sharing a ``run_date`` re-measure one software state, and pooling them into one
point is what keeps a stack that did not move from looking like a metric that
wobbled. Every point states how many nights it aggregates and how many of those
were actually judged, because "measured and flat" and "recorded but never
assessed" are different evidence and only one of them is a control.

Nothing here judges anything. The engine has already decided what each night
was; this is a bounded, chronological read of that decision.
