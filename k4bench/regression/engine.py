"""Statistical step-change detector for nightly benchmark metrics.

Detection is deliberately conservative — the goal is a report developers trust,
so every gate errs toward *not* flagging:

1. **Baseline**: the trailing :data:`BASELINE_WINDOW_RUNS` *reliable* runs
   strictly before the night under test. Runs failing the conservative host
   reliability check (:mod:`k4bench.results.reliability`) never enter the
   baseline and are never themselves evaluated — contention is not a
   regression. Configs identified as failed are likewise removed by the report
   assembly before a metric series reaches this engine, so their partial
   measurements are gaps rather than baseline points. Below
   :data:`MIN_BASELINE_RUNS` reliable points the verdict is ``UNKNOWN``, never a
   flag (no evidence ⇒ no verdict).
2. **Robust statistics**: the baseline center/spread are the median and the
   normal-consistent MAD (:data:`MAD_NORMAL_CONSISTENCY` × MAD), not
   mean/stddev, so one contaminated night that slipped past the reliability
   filter cannot distort the threshold.
3. **Robust z-gate**: flag only beyond :data:`Z_THRESHOLD` (the
   Iglewicz–Hoaglin robust-outlier threshold).
4. **Practical-effect floor** (:data:`EFFECT_FLOOR`), ANDed with the z-gate: a
   metric that is normally rock-steady has a tiny MAD, so the z-gate alone
   would trip on practically irrelevant wobbles.
5. **Two-strike confirmation**: the first night crossing both gates is
   ``WATCH``; only when the *next* reliable night repeats it in the same
   direction does it become ``CONFIRMED``. This is the single
   highest-leverage lever against false positives (the pattern used by
   Chromium's and Firefox's perf-CI bots) — more effective than tightening
   the z-gate, which just trades false positives for missed regressions.
   The confirming night may belong to the same Key4hep release as the WATCH
   night (the nightly stack does not publish daily, so consecutive runs
   often re-measure one release): a second run of the same binary tripping
   the same way is independent evidence that rules out a one-night machine
   fluke.
6. **Change-point re-anchoring at release boundaries**: the unit of change
   is the *release*; nights are repeat measurements of it. All nights
   sharing a ``run_date`` (the release date) are judged against one frozen
   baseline snapshot, and a confirmation is sticky for the rest of its
   release — every later night of the release tripping the same way is also
   ``CONFIRMED``, with the same onset window, because the regression is a
   property of the release and every re-measurement of it should say so.
   Sticky, but not unconditional: the confirmed state holds only while the
   *median* of the release's judged nights still clears the gates. One quiet
   night cannot outvote the two that confirmed, but once quiet nights drag
   the release median back inside the band, the confirming nights are best
   explained as noise — the confirmation is revoked, and the baseline is
   never re-anchored onto a fluke level.
   Only when the walk *leaves* a release that confirmed a change is the
   baseline re-anchored on that release's values: the confirmed level
   becomes the new accepted one, so an *expected* regression (say, a
   deliberate physics change) alerts once per release transition instead of
   being re-judged against the pre-change median for weeks. While the new
   segment is short, judging continues against its median with the
   pre-change spread as the noise proxy, so a second change arriving right
   away is still caught. The state is recomputed from the history on every
   walk, so there is no state file to manage.
7. **No good/bad judgment**: a confirmed change is reported as ``UP`` or
   ``DOWN`` — a plain sign, not an evaluation. Faster is not "improved" any
   more than slower is "regressed" in the colloquial sense: either can be a
   deliberate change, an optimization, or a bug, and the report leaves that
   call to a human instead of asserting one.
8. **The event sample is not engine state**: which Monte-Carlo events a run
   simulated — a fresh draw, or a fixed ddsim seed — is recorded on the run
   (and headlined in the report when it changes) but never acts on the walk.
   A history is one continuous series across a seed change: the level it
   lands on is judged against the baseline like any other, and the two-strike
   rule plus the release-median gate decide whether it holds. Nothing is
   left unjudged and no baseline is re-anchored on the changeover, so a
   change arriving in the same window keeps a bounded onset window to
   attribute it with.

A platform migration is the one case where part of the baseline comes from
somewhere else: a young platform may be seeded with the baseline a *predecessor*
platform's own walk ended on (see :mod:`k4bench.regression.lineage`) — the level
that platform had settled on, so a change it already confirmed and re-anchored
against is not handed over as unfinished business. Seed points are baseline
evidence only — never judged — and are evicted one by one as the platform's own
nights arrive, so it is judged against itself alone within a window.

Every series reaching this engine is a measurement: what a configuration
recorded, judged against its own history. A night where every configuration of
a run group moved together is reported once per configuration, because that is
what was measured — collapsing the repetition is a rendering concern, not a
judging one.

Known v1 limitations (deliberate):

- Slow drift (a creeping regression too small to trip step detection) is out
  of scope — "Phase 5 (not built)". Gathering a track record on the
  step detector comes first; Mann-Kendall/EWMA can be layered on later.

    - ``run_date`` — datetime-like, defines the evaluation order,
    - ``value`` — the metric value (NaN/None rows are skipped),
    - ``reliable`` — the per-run reliability tri-state
      (``True``/``False``/``None``). Only ``False`` excludes a run: an
      *unknown* verdict (no machine info) is not evidence of contention, and
      excluding it would starve baselines on histories without machine info —
      the same policy as the dashboard's reliability filter.

    *baseline_seed* is the optional history of a *predecessor* platform for this
    same series (see :mod:`k4bench.regression.lineage`), filling the baseline
    window while the platform is too young to have one of its own. It is walked
    the same way this history is, and what enters the window is the baseline
    that walk ended on — the level in force at the migration, together with the
    change-point it was still settling onto, if any (see :func:`_seed_state`).
    Seed points produce no verdict, are not part of the returned series, and
    must predate both the first release and the first measurement they help
    judge. They are evicted one at a time as the platform's own values arrive — gone after
    :data:`BASELINE_WINDOW_RUNS` of them, or at once when a confirmed change
    re-anchors the baseline. A migration step is therefore judged like any
    other step, and the verdicts judged against a seeded window say so in
    ``baseline_inherited_from``.

    The unit of change is the **release**: nights sharing a ``run_date`` are
    repeat measurements of one software state, and all engine state transitions
    happen at those boundaries. Rows whose release date is
    unknown fall back to their run date and therefore form single-night
    groups, where the walk degrades to a plain night-by-night pass. Within a
    release, every judged night is compared against one baseline snapshot
    ``(median, MAD)`` frozen on entering the release from state accumulated
    under earlier releases only — so every report night of one release
    agrees on what the release was judged against. The two-strike pending
    state still moves night by night (a WATCH set by an earlier night of the
    same release confirms on a later one — a second run of the same binary
    is independent evidence against a machine fluke; a clean night clears an
    unconfirmed WATCH). Unreliable runs are skipped entirely — they neither
    confirm nor reset a pending WATCH, since there is no evidence either way
    for that night. Returns the full verdict series (the dashboard
    drill-down shades from it); callers wanting "tonight's" verdict take the
    last element.

    A confirmation is **sticky while the release's evidence supports it**:
    once a change is confirmed in a direction, every later night of the
    release tripping the same way is also ``CONFIRMED`` and carries the
    *same* ``onset_*``/``last_accepted_*`` window (the regression is a
    property of the release, and every night re-measuring it reports it
    identically — identical windows also keep the blame sidecar's per-window
    dedup stable). A single OK night inside the release does not clear the
    confirmed state — it is reported OK with a note that the release median
    still sits beyond the baseline. But retention is decided by that median:
    when enough quiet nights pull the median of the release's judged values
    back inside the gates, the confirmation is revoked (the confirming
    nights were more likely noise), a later trip starts a fresh two-strike
    cycle, and the release triggers no boundary re-anchor.

    Leaving a release that confirmed a change is the **change-point**: the
    baseline window is re-anchored there (cleared and re-seeded with all of
    the release's reliable judged values), so an expected/accepted change
    alerts on the release that introduced it and on every re-measurement of
    that release, then falls quiet from the next release on. While the new
    segment is still short (< :data:`MIN_BASELINE_RUNS` points) the walk
    keeps judging — against the growing segment's median, with the
    *pre-change* scaled MAD as the spread proxy (the noise level changes far
    less than the level itself) — so a second change arriving right after a
    confirmed one is still caught rather than falling into a blind window.
    A release that confirmed nothing simply appends its judged values to the
    baseline in night order and carries any still-pending WATCH forward.

    Each ``CONFIRMED`` verdict also carries the window the change entered in:
    ``onset_*`` (the WATCH night — where it first appeared, one reliable night
    before it was confirmed) and ``last_accepted_*`` (the newest night before
    that whose value ruled this change out). Because confirmation trails
    onset, the confirmed night is the wrong place to look for a cause; the
    change landed in ``(last_accepted, onset]``. Both ends may fall inside
    one release (first night OK, later nights confirm): such a same-release
    window proves the stack did not move between them. An unreliable night
    inside the window is skipped, not judged, so it never narrows the
    window — it is spanned by it.

    The base end is read per direction: a night is evidence against a change
    *this* way if it sat within baseline variation, and equally if it tripped
    the *other* way — a value on the far side of the baseline is further still
    from where a change this way would have put it. So an unrelated one-night
    swing upward does not push the base of a later downward step back past it,
    and the sibling metrics of one run group, which usually step together,
    keep agreeing on one window instead of fanning out over their own noise.
