"""Where inside the detector a timing step landed.

A confirmed run-level regression is one number, and one number names no
mechanism: "ALLEGRO got 21% slower" and "the HCAL barrel got fourteen times
slower while everything else stood still" are the same measurement, but only the
second can be matched against a diff. The ``k4BenchRegionTimingAction`` plugin
records per-event time per top-level detector region on every run, so the second
form is already measured — it has simply never been read by anything that
attributes a regression.

This module reads it: for one benchmark configuration and one change window, how
each region's per-event time differs between the two ends the change entered
between — the two releases, or the window's two runs when one release holds
both. It judges nothing (the engine has already decided *that* the metric
stepped) and it introduces no thresholds of its own; it reports the
decomposition, largest movement first, and leaves the reading to whoever asked.

Two costs shape the implementation. Region files are per *configuration* and hold
per-event arrays, so loading a whole trend window across every label is
expensive — this loads exactly the two ends of one window, for one label, and
only when something actually regressed there. And a release that recorded no
region file is *absent*, never zero: a region that appears on one side of a
window only is a real event (a detector added, removed or renamed) and must stay
distinguishable from one that stood still.
