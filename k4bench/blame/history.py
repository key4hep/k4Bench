"""On-demand historical code evidence: what changed at *older* release boundaries.

Both blame passes reason about one change window. The evidence around it is rich
— the metric's own release tail, the configurations that stayed flat, the
candidates' real diffs — but the tail itself arrives as bare numbers. A model
that notices "this series took a step of exactly this shape entering 2026-06-14
as well" has nowhere to go with the observation: it is shown *how many* packages
moved at that boundary and nothing about which ones, let alone the code.

This module is the bounded way to close that gap. It is a **controller-managed
retrieval protocol**, not a browsing tool, and the distinction is the whole
design:

* The application builds a small, offline **index** of older boundaries
  (:func:`build_index`) — package names, repository slugs, add/change/remove
  status — and hands it to the model with application-generated opaque ids
  (``h1``, ``h2``, …). No GitHub call is made to build it.
* The model may answer with a :class:`HistoricalRequest` naming *only* ids and
  package names the index offered (:func:`parse_request`). Anything else — an
  invented id, a repository, a commit, a URL, a boundary the index explicitly
  said it could not read — is a **decline**, never a fetch.
* The application resolves that validated selection through the provenance it
  has already read and the authenticated GitHub client it already holds, under
  hard caps (:data:`MAX_BOUNDARIES` … :data:`MAX_PRS`), and gets back a
  :class:`HistoricalEvidence` that is either **complete** or refused.

Two properties are load-bearing, and everything here exists to keep them:

* **Historical pull requests are analogues, never candidates.** They come from
  releases the current window does not contain, so they cannot have caused the
  current regression by construction. Nothing in this module produces a
  :class:`~k4bench.blame.rank.RankCandidate`, and
  :func:`~k4bench.blame.rank._parse_rankings`' only-reorder rule drops one that
  is echoed as a ranking anyway.

* **Incomplete evidence is refused, never sampled.** A model that asked for this
  evidence asked because it expected to reason from it; handing it three of five
  pull requests, or a boundary whose provenance turned out to be unreadable,
  produces a judgement made on a partial view of a question the model itself
  said mattered. :attr:`HistoricalEvidence.complete` is the flag, and the ranker
  turns a false one into an unranked window — the same honest failure every
  other incomplete evidence path in :mod:`k4bench.blame` produces.

The feature is **on wherever a model and a GitHub token are configured**, and
:data:`HISTORICAL_DIFFS_ENV` turns it back off. Off, no index is built, no extra
model call is possible, and every prompt, call count and artifact is
byte-for-byte what it was before this module existed — which is what makes the
switch a usable one to reach for.

# ── The bounds ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

#: Older boundaries described in the index. The tail a verdict carries is a
#: dozen releases; offering all of them would spend prompt on boundaries no
#: model will look past, and widen the surface a request is validated against
#: for no gain. The most recent ones are the ones a step is compared against.
MAX_INDEX_BOUNDARIES = 8

#: Packages *named* per boundary in the index. A Key4hep release boundary moves
#: a handful on an ordinary night and dozens after a quiet week. The overflow is
#: counted and stated (:attr:`HistoricalBoundary.packages_omitted`), never
#: silently dropped: a list that shows 25 of 37 and says nothing invites the
#: model to conclude that package 26 did not change, which is a false
#: exculpation built out of a display cap.
MAX_INDEX_PACKAGES = 25

#: Boundaries one request may name. Two is enough for "this happened before, and
#: before that" and small enough that the follow-up prompt stays a prompt.
MAX_BOUNDARIES = 2

#: Packages one request may name **per boundary**. The model is choosing where
#: to look, not enumerating the release; a request wider than this is a request
#: for the whole diff, which is what this protocol exists not to send.
MAX_PACKAGES_PER_BOUNDARY = 2

#: Pull requests retrieved in total, across every boundary and package. A
#: selection whose ranges hold more than this cannot be read *completely*, and
#: an incompletely read selection is refused rather than sampled — see
#: :class:`HistoricalEvidence`.
MAX_PRS = 4

#: Chars of historical *diff* rendered into a prompt, in total. Unlike the caps
#: above this one is a rendering budget, not a retrieval bound: the patches are
#: already whole (each bounded per file and per PR by
#: :mod:`k4bench.blame.github`), and the budget waterfills across them exactly
#: as the candidates' own budget does, so historical evidence can never crowd
#: the current window's diffs out of the prompt. Clipping here is marked in the
#: text, the way every other clipped diff in these prompts is.
MAX_DIFF_CHARS = 10000

#: Analogues one *comment* may carry into the cross-configuration review.
#:
#: :data:`MAX_PRS` bounds one rank group, but a comment window unions the
#: selections of every rank group inside it — several detectors, samples and
#: platforms, each of which asked its own question — so the per-group bound says
#: nothing about the total. Without this, a wide night could hand one review
#: dozens of analogues: dozens of GitHub round trips inside one shared timeout,
#: and a prompt whose historical half dwarfs the window it is background to.
#:
#: Three rank groups' worth. Exceeding it **suppresses the comment** rather than
#: dropping analogues, because dropping some would break the one property this
#: whole path exists for — that both passes weigh the same evidence — and would
#: break it silently. A night that wide is a bug to look at, in the same spirit
#: as the comment-storm cap.
MAX_COMMENT_ANALOGUES = 3 * MAX_PRS

#: Longest reason kept from the model's request. It is a sentence justifying the
#: retrieval, logged for the operator; it never reaches a prompt.

    pass keeps when it de-duplicates the persisted references, so both passes
    name the analogue the same way.
