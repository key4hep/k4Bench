"""Rank a regression's candidate pull requests with a language model.

The builder collects, for one release-boundary window, every pull request in
the commit range of every package that moved across it — but *which* of them
caused the step is a judgement over the real diffs, not a path match. This
module makes that judgement with a model: it is handed every metric that
stepped across the window and each candidate's code change, and returns a
0–100 likelihood and a one-line reason per PR.

Three properties are load-bearing, and shape the whole module:

* **Model-independence.** The one adapter, :class:`OpenAICompatRanker`, is a
  prompt and a parser over a :class:`~k4bench.blame.llm.ChatClient` — the shared
  OpenAI-compatible transport, with no vendor SDK and no pinned model. Provider,
  model and key are environment variables (:func:`ranker_from_env`), so switching
  from one free endpoint to another is a settings change, never a code change.
  :class:`Ranker` is a ``Protocol`` so a second adapter can drop in without the
  builder knowing.

* **Only-reorder.** The model may only score the candidates it was given.
  :func:`_parse_rankings` drops any ``(repo, pr)`` the request did not contain,
  so a hallucinated PR number is structurally impossible to surface — never
  merely unlikely. The builder drops unknown keys a second time (defence in
  depth).

* **Honest failure.** Every failure path — no config, HTTP error, timeout,
  malformed JSON — returns ``{}``. "No ranking" is a real state the rest of the
  pipeline already handles (the dashboard hides the ledger, the email omits the
  "most likely" line); a confident wrong culprit would be worse than none. The
  score is a *lead for a human*, in keeping with this repo's "no evidence ⇒ no
  verdict" culture — never a verdict.
