"""Serialized shapes for ``_reports/{night}/blame.json``.

The file is a :class:`BlameReport`: one :class:`BlameEntry` per confirmed
regression, each carrying the release window it entered in and the repos that
moved across that window, and within each repo the ranked candidate pull
requests. The identity fields on :class:`BlameEntry` (``detector`` … ``metric``,
``sub_detector``) are exactly a :class:`~k4bench.regression.models.MetricVerdict`'s
identity, so the dashboard joins an entry back to the verdict it explains with
:meth:`BlameReport.entry_for` — matched on that tuple *and* the blame window, so
an entry written for an earlier build of the same night can never attach to a
verdict whose window has since moved.

Everything here is a plain, frozen dataclass with explicit JSON round-tripping.
:func:`from_json` drops unknown keys rather than raising: ``blame.json`` is read
by whatever dashboard is deployed, not necessarily one built from the commit
that wrote the file, so a schema that gains a field must not break older readers
(the same forward-compatibility rule :mod:`k4bench.regression.render` follows for
``report.json``). Structurally wrong JSON, on the other hand, raises
:class:`BlameSchemaError` — one dedicated exception the readers at the
integration boundaries (dashboard, notifier) catch to hide blame rather than
crash.

    Release dates alone identify a cross-release window: every metric of one
    run group that stepped across one release boundary shares that boundary's
    package diff and candidate set, so they belong together.

    A **same-release** window has no such boundary to share. Its releases are
    equal by definition, so keying on them alone would collapse genuinely
    different change windows — ``run1 → run2`` and ``run2 → run3`` inside one
    release are two different pairs of runs, two different harness commit
    ranges, and two different sets of pull requests. Collapsed, a shared range
    derived from them degenerates (the newest base run can meet the oldest
    onset run, or overtake it) and both windows lose or misstate their
    attribution. So the run ids join the key exactly there, and nowhere else —
    a cross-release group keeps its existing identity, with the run slots
    ``None`` so the tuple shape never varies.

    Lives in this module, beside the schema, because the same grouping has to
    hold everywhere these windows are formed or shown — the blame builder, the
    dashboard's window picker, the nightly email's ranking cards. Three private
    re-derivations of one rule is how those three drift apart. *verdict* is
    duck-typed for the same reason the rest of this module is: it keeps the
    schema free of a dependency on the engine's models.
