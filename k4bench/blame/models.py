"""Serialized shapes for ``_reports/{night}/blame.json``.

The file is a :class:`BlameReport`: one :class:`BlameEntry` per confirmed
regression, each carrying the release window it entered in and the repos that
moved across that window, and within each repo the ranked candidate pull
requests. The identity fields on :class:`BlameEntry` (``detector`` … ``metric``,
``sub_detector``) are exactly a :class:`~k4bench.regression.models.MetricVerdict`'s
identity, so the dashboard joins an entry back to the verdict it explains with
:meth:`BlameReport.entry_for` — matched on that tuple *and* the blame window, so
an entry written for an earlier build of the same night can never attach to a
verdict whose window has since moved.

Everything here is a plain, frozen dataclass with explicit JSON round-tripping.
:func:`from_json` drops unknown keys rather than raising: ``blame.json`` is read
by whatever dashboard is deployed, not necessarily one built from the commit
that wrote the file, so a schema that gains a field must not break older readers
(the same forward-compatibility rule :mod:`k4bench.regression.render` follows for
``report.json``). Structurally wrong JSON, on the other hand, raises
:class:`BlameSchemaError` — one dedicated exception the readers at the
integration boundaries (dashboard, notifier) catch to hide blame rather than
crash.

    every candidate of a regression together and assigns each its own
