"""Assemble a :class:`~k4bench.blame.models.BlameReport` from a nightly report.

For each confirmed regression whose blame window spans two *different* releases,
diff the two releases' package maps, resolve each changed GitHub repo's commit
range to its pull requests, and rank them for that regression. The result is the
sidecar the CLI uploads to ``_reports/{night}/blame.json``.

Two dependencies are injected rather than imported, which is what keeps this
module offline-testable and lets CI reuse work it has already done:

* ``packages_for_release(platform, release) -> dict | None`` — a release's
  ``k4h_packages`` map. In CI this reads the run cache the report build already
  populated; the integration test reads a local tree. ``None`` means the release
  predates provenance capture or has aged off CVMFS — its regressions get no
  blame rather than a wrong one.
* ``github`` — a :class:`~k4bench.blame.github.GitHubClient`, or ``None`` to skip
  PR resolution entirely (no token available): the diffs are still recorded, the
  repos just carry no candidates.

Windows that cannot be attributed are dropped, not recorded empty: an open-ended
window (no settled baseline), a same-release window (nothing upstream moved), and
a window whose provenance is missing are all handled live by the dashboard from
``report.json`` alone. ``blame.json`` exists only to carry the one thing the
dashboard cannot compute itself — the ranked PRs.
