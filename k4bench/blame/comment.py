"""Decide which pull requests hear about a regression, and what they are told.

The nightly ranker already answers "which PR most likely caused this step"
(:mod:`k4bench.blame.rank`), but that answer only reaches people who read the
e-group mail or open the dashboard — never the author of the change. This module
turns a night's ``report.json`` + ``blame.json`` into a set of pull-request
comments; :mod:`k4bench.blame.publish` posts them.

The work happens in two halves, because they have different failure domains:

* :func:`select` is **pure** — no network, no token, no clock — so the whole
  "who gets told what" decision is unit-testable, and the CLI can print exactly
  what would be posted (``--dry-run``) without touching GitHub.
* :func:`build_comments` renders those selections, and is where the optional
  second model pass (:mod:`k4bench.blame.attribute`) and the diff fetch it needs
  arrive — as *injected callables*, the same seam
  :mod:`k4bench.blame.builder` uses for its ranker.

Commenting in someone else's repository is an outward-facing act on the strength
of a model's judgement, so the gates are deliberately narrow and all of them
must pass:

* the candidate's repository is on the **allowlist** — an empty allowlist means
  the bot is inert;
* the ranker actually **judged** the candidate — an unranked one has no opinion
  attached to it, and no threshold is low enough to be cleared by a missing
  judgement;
* the ranker's likelihood is at or above ``min_score`` (default 80);
* the pull request is **merged** — an open PR cannot have shipped in a release;
* the blame entry's candidate discovery and changed-file evidence were **complete**
  (:attr:`~k4bench.blame.models.BlameEntry.discovery_incomplete`) — naming one PR
  out of a knowingly partial set, or from partial path evidence, is exactly the
  overclaim the ranker itself refuses to make;
* the night is under the ``max_comments`` cap — a storm is a bug, not a night;
* and, when a cross-configuration review ran, it did not acquit the pull request
  outright (:func:`build_comments`'s withdrawal gate).

One comment covers one pull request and one change-window lineage — the reader's
question is "did my change do this?", asked once. A strictly expanding or
contracting window is a newer view of the same finding, while non-containing
windows remain distinct. :func:`marker_for` names the current window, and the
publisher migrates the nearest comparable marker. A containing window's bounded
detail table reserves the globally strongest row and one row for each represented
onset before filling the remaining places by attribution likelihood. Rows that stopped being
confirmed are not simply dropped: each material version carries a bounded,
validated snapshot of its strongest rows (:class:`RetainedRow`), and the next
version's table resurfaces the ones that still outrank tonight's evidence —
dated, annotated with their current report standing, and never rescored. A
collapsed observation history retains the newest material reports behind
immutable dashboard links. The dashboard remains the complete view.

A comment is written once and thereafter only *edited*, never retracted: when
the regression resolves, or the candidate drops below ``min_score``, tonight's
selection simply stops producing it and the comment already on the pull request
is left exactly as it stands. That is deliberate. It records what the benchmarks
saw at the time — which remains true after the metric recovers — and silently
rewriting or deleting a comment people may have replied to is worse than leaving
a dated one in place. Follow-ups belong in the thread.

    two nights ago deserves to keep seeing that finding, dated, rather than have
    it silently vanish under weaker rows. So every material comment version
    carries a bounded list of these snapshots in one versioned marker, and the

    Driven from the *report*'s confirmed regressions rather than from the
    sidecar's entries, so a comment can only ever describe a regression that is
    confirmed in tonight's report — a stale entry has nothing to attach to.

    Selection and evidence collection are **two passes**, and the order matters.

    *Phase one* finds the targets: a ``(repo, number, base, onset)`` for which
    some blame entry — one with complete candidate discovery — carries a ranked
    first-pass judgement of a merged, allowlisted pull request at or above
    ``min_score``. Nothing else can cause a comment.

    *Phase two* then rebuilds each target's evidence from the **whole window**,
    not from the entries the pull request happened to appear in. Every confirmed
    regression whose onset falls inside the window becomes a row, and each row
    records what the first pass knew about the subject *there*
    (:data:`~k4bench.blame.attribute.ScopeCandidateState`):

    * it was a candidate and was scored — the prior the review starts from;
    * it was a candidate and was not scored — unknown, and never a zero;
    * it was **not** a candidate and the search there was complete — the
      strongest exculpatory evidence this pipeline produces, and precisely the
      row a one-pass collection loses, because a pull request absent from a
      scope's candidate list never reaches the loop that would collect it;
    * discovery there was incomplete (or the sidecar has no entry for it at
      all) — nothing follows from absence, and the row says so.

    Collecting rows by candidacy — the obvious shape — is wrong in both
    directions. It drops the row where the subject scored 30 (the exculpatory
    half of an accusation that scored 92 elsewhere), and it drops the row where
    the subject is not a candidate at all: "IDEA regressed in the same window and
    this change is not even in the range that produced it" is the single most
    useful thing the review can be told, and it lives in an entry the subject
    does not appear in. Neither would resurface as negative evidence either —
    :func:`_outcomes_for` correctly refuses to call a configuration clean when it
    confirmed a step in this window, so a dropped row is invisible, not demoted.

    An incomplete scope is **represented, never suppressed**: it renders and
    prompts as "no conclusion available here". Suppressing the whole comment for
    it was the other candidate rule, and was rejected — the accusation itself
    already requires a *complete* scope to have cleared the threshold, so an
    unrelated truncated range on some other detector adds no risk of a false
    claim, while silencing on it would let one force-pushed branch anywhere in
    the stack mute a well-evidenced comment. What is not acceptable is dropping
    such a scope silently, which is what makes this a stated state rather than a
    filter.

    Overshooting ``max_comments`` raises :class:`CommentStormError` rather than
    returning a truncated list — a night that loud is a bug, not a night, and
    blind-posting ten accusations into repositories k4Bench does not own is the
    exact harm the gates exist to prevent. It is raised, not returned empty, so
    the caller can tell it apart from an ordinary night that simply implicated

    With an *attributor* configured, every plan gets one cross-configuration
    review (:mod:`k4bench.blame.attribute`) whose likelihoods order and fill the
    table. What the review cannot do is *widen*: it never introduces a pull
    request selection did not already implicate, and the only outcome it adds is
    withdrawal — a plan is dropped when no row is left standing at or above
    *min_score*. Within a plan it is a genuine second opinion, and an individual
    row's likelihood may come back higher than the first pass's as well as
    lower: that pass scored the row without ever seeing the other
    configurations, which is the deficiency this one exists to correct.

    **A configured review that does not answer produces no comment at all.**
    Not a fallback rendered from the first-pass scores — nothing. Two reasons,
    and the second is the load-bearing one:

    * The first pass asks the weaker question. It is enough to *select* a pull
      request; the whole premise of this stage is that a claim posted into
      someone else's repository deserves the cross-configuration reading too.
      An endpoint that is down is not a reason to lower that bar.
    * It makes comment quality **monotonic**, which nothing else here can. A
      degraded comment posted tonight and a reviewed comment rendered tomorrow
      rest on the *same* benchmark facts, so the digest is the same and
      :mod:`k4bench.blame.publish` would refuse the edit — the degraded body
      would stand forever, however many later reviews succeeded. Skipping the
      night instead means a standing comment is simply left alone and the next
      working review posts the real thing. A comment can therefore only ever
      improve: no review, then reviewed, and never back again.

    With no attributor configured at all the comment renders from the
    per-configuration scores, which is the whole of what this bot did before
    this stage existed and a coherent mode in its own right — every comment in
    it rests on the same evidence as every other.

    "Left standing" is the operative phrase in the withdrawal gate: it reads
    each row's *effective* likelihood, the review's score where it gave one and
    the per-configuration score where it did not. A partial reply is an accepted
    outcome (:func:`~k4bench.blame.attribute._parse_attribution`), so measuring
    withdrawal on the review's scores alone would let one low answer about one
    row acquit a pull request the review never disputed on the others.

    Archive links pin the report being rendered. Report dates stay outside the
    facts digest, so a regression that stands unchanged for a week remains one
    untouched comment. Observation history is merged at the write boundary.

    It opens with the measurement and only then estimates, because they are two
    different kinds of statement and the comment is careful to keep them apart
    everywhere else. The estimate is named as one — so a reader who stops at the
    alert stops at percentages rather than at an unqualified accusation — and the
    model behind it is said out loud, matching what the assessment below calls
    itself.

    Once materialized, the measured totals and score clauses describe the same
    exact identity union over the comment lineage. A reconfirmed identity keeps
    only its newest published attribution.

    A peak alone is misleading, so each clause pairs it with *reach*: one row at
    95% out of forty reads very differently from thirty-eight of them, and the
    count of rows at or above the threshold is what tells them apart. (A window
    of one regression has no reach to report, and says the one score.) The
    threshold is named rather than summarised as "certain": it is a configured
    number (``min_score``), the same one that decided this comment exists at all,
    and a reader who thinks it is set wrong can go and see what it is set to.

    Every number is attributed to whoever produced it (:func:`_scored`), in one
    clause per model. A partial review is the case that makes this matter: the
    reviewer answers one row at 20%, the comment survives on another row the
    ranker left at 91%, and a single blended sentence would credit the reviewer
    with a claim it did not make while contradicting the count it did. Hence
    "likely contributor" is claimed only by a model whose own scores actually
    reach the threshold.

    The publisher edits a standing comment only when the digest over this
    changes (:func:`k4bench.blame.publish._upsert`), and an edit re-notifies
    everyone subscribed to the pull request. So the rule is two-sided, and both
    sides matter: a fact that changes what the comment claims must be in, and a
    number that moves on its own every night must be out.

    **In**: the window; every regression row's identity — platform included —
    how far it moved, and its own change window (the Change window column and
    each row's deep link route through it, and a row's window can move while
    the plan's outer window stands still); what the first pass knew about this pull request
    in each of those scopes; the clean and watch outcomes with their watched
    metrics and unjudged counts; the per-platform package diff and unchanged
    counts; which pull requests were in the field and whether each was judged;
    which older-boundary pull requests the first pass read before scoring
    (:attr:`CommentPlan.historical_refs`); and whether the review's evidence —
    the subject's and competitors' diffs — could actually be fetched.

    The outcomes especially. A comment posted while IDEA had no reliable result
    reads differently once IDEA delivers a clean measurement of the same window
    — that control weakens the attribution and the review is shown it — and a
    digest covering only the positive rows would leave the old reasoning
    standing on the pull request forever, because nothing it hashed had moved.
    Diff availability is the same argument: a night where GitHub refused the
    patch produces a review made from paths and titles, and the night the fetch
    succeeds is a materially better-evidenced comment, not a reworded one.

    **Out**: the narrative, and every model score — the review's likelihoods and
    the ranker's scoring alike. Those drift between nights without anything
    having happened, and a competitor sliding from 84.4 to 84.6 is not worth
    re-notifying everyone watching a pull request. (Whether a candidate was
    scored *at all* is a different thing, and is in: it changes the table cell
    and the prompt from a percentage to "not scored".)

    **Also out, and less obviously so**: ``value``, ``baseline_median`` and
    ``z_score``. They are deterministic and they do reach the review's prompt,
    but they are *tonight's* measurement of a standing regression — the engine
    re-derives them from the latest run every night, so they move whenever the
    benchmark is re-run, which is nightly. Hashing them would edit every
    standing comment every night, which is the exact harm this digest exists to
    prevent. ``pct_change`` is the same kind of number and is included only at
    the precision the comment *displays* it (:func:`_canonical_pct`), so the
    digest changes when the visible table does and not before.

    Serialized as canonical JSON rather than joined strings so a field's value
    can never migrate into its neighbour's — ``a|b`` and ``a`` + ``|b`` hash
    alike, and identities here are user-supplied names.

      same rule to the references this module writes itself, and the review is

      needs no Markdown at all to become a link. A pull-request URL autolinked
      this way also cross-references that PR's timeline, which is the very
      notification :func:`_pr_ref` goes out of its way not to send.

    A zero-width space at each sequence's join breaks what GitHub would act on
