"""Decide which pull requests hear about a regression, and what they are told.

The nightly ranker already answers "which PR most likely caused this step"
(:mod:`k4bench.blame.rank`), but that answer only reaches people who read the
e-group mail or open the dashboard — never the author of the change. This module
turns a night's ``report.json`` + ``blame.json`` into a set of pull-request
comments; :mod:`k4bench.blame.publish` posts them.

The work happens in two halves, because they have different failure domains:

* :func:`select` is **pure** — no network, no token, no clock — so the whole
  "who gets told what" decision is unit-testable, and the CLI can print exactly
  what would be posted (``--dry-run``) without touching GitHub.
* :func:`build_comments` renders those selections, and is where the optional
  second model pass (:mod:`k4bench.blame.attribute`) and the diff fetch it needs
  arrive — as *injected callables*, the same seam
  :mod:`k4bench.blame.builder` uses for its ranker.

Commenting in someone else's repository is an outward-facing act on the strength
of a model's judgement, so the gates are deliberately narrow and all of them
must pass:

* the candidate's repository is on the **allowlist** — an empty allowlist means
  the bot is inert;
* the ranker actually **judged** the candidate — an unranked one has no opinion
  attached to it, and no threshold is low enough to be cleared by a missing
  judgement;
* the ranker's likelihood is at or above ``min_score`` (default 80);
* the pull request is **merged** — an open PR cannot have shipped in a release;
* the blame entry's candidate discovery was **complete**
  (:attr:`~k4bench.blame.models.BlameEntry.discovery_incomplete`) — naming one PR
  out of a knowingly partial set is exactly the overclaim the ranker itself
  refuses to make;
* the night is under the ``max_comments`` cap — a storm is a bug, not a night;
* and, when a cross-configuration review ran, it did not acquit the pull request
  outright (:func:`build_comments`'s withdrawal gate).

One comment covers one ``(pull request, change window)`` pair — the reader's
question is "did my change do this?", asked once — and :func:`marker_for` gives
that pair a stable hidden key so a later night edits the existing comment
instead of posting a second one. Everything the window regressed goes into one
table ordered by attribution likelihood, across every detector, sample, platform
and benchmark configuration: which configurations moved *and which did not* is
the substance of the claim, so it is one table a reader can scan rather than one
configuration in full and the rest in a footnote. That table shows only its top
few rows, and one line under it counts the window's regressions and links all of
them in the dashboard, which is where any other reading of the night — by step
size, by configuration, over time — already lives.

A comment is written once and thereafter only *edited*, never retracted: when
the regression resolves, or the candidate drops below ``min_score``, tonight's
selection simply stops producing it and the comment already on the pull request
is left exactly as it stands. That is deliberate. It records what the benchmarks
saw at the time — which remains true after the metric recovers — and silently
rewriting or deleting a comment people may have replied to is worse than leaving
a dated one in place. Follow-ups belong in the thread.

    Driven from the *report*'s confirmed regressions rather than from the
    sidecar's entries, so a comment can only ever describe a regression that is
    confirmed in tonight's report — a stale entry has nothing to attach to.

    Selection and evidence collection are **two passes**, and the order matters.

    *Phase one* finds the targets: a ``(repo, number, base, onset)`` for which
    some blame entry — one with complete candidate discovery — carries a ranked
    first-pass judgement of a merged, allowlisted pull request at or above
    ``min_score``. Nothing else can cause a comment.

    *Phase two* then rebuilds each target's evidence from the **whole window**,
    not from the entries the pull request happened to appear in. Every confirmed
    regression whose onset falls inside the window becomes a row, and each row
    records what the first pass knew about the subject *there*
    (:data:`~k4bench.blame.attribute.ScopeCandidateState`):

    * it was a candidate and was scored — the prior the review starts from;
    * it was a candidate and was not scored — unknown, and never a zero;
    * it was **not** a candidate and the search there was complete — the
      strongest exculpatory evidence this pipeline produces, and precisely the
      row a one-pass collection loses, because a pull request absent from a
      scope's candidate list never reaches the loop that would collect it;
    * discovery there was incomplete (or the sidecar has no entry for it at
      all) — nothing follows from absence, and the row says so.

    Collecting rows by candidacy — the obvious shape — is wrong in both
    directions. It drops the row where the subject scored 30 (the exculpatory
    half of an accusation that scored 92 elsewhere), and it drops the row where
    the subject is not a candidate at all: "IDEA regressed in the same window and
    this change is not even in the range that produced it" is the single most
    useful thing the review can be told, and it lives in an entry the subject
    does not appear in. Neither would resurface as negative evidence either —
    :func:`_outcomes_for` correctly refuses to call a configuration clean when it
    confirmed a step in this window, so a dropped row is invisible, not demoted.

    An incomplete scope is **represented, never suppressed**: it renders and
    prompts as "no conclusion available here". Suppressing the whole comment for
    it was the other candidate rule, and was rejected — the accusation itself
    already requires a *complete* scope to have cleared the threshold, so an
    unrelated truncated range on some other detector adds no risk of a false
    claim, while silencing on it would let one force-pushed branch anywhere in
    the stack mute a well-evidenced comment. What is not acceptable is dropping
    such a scope silently, which is what makes this a stated state rather than a
    filter.

    Overshooting ``max_comments`` raises :class:`CommentStormError` rather than
    returning a truncated list — a night that loud is a bug, not a night, and
    blind-posting ten accusations into repositories k4Bench does not own is the
    exact harm the gates exist to prevent. It is raised, not returned empty, so
    the caller can tell it apart from an ordinary night that simply implicated

    With an *attributor* configured, every plan gets one cross-configuration
    review (:mod:`k4bench.blame.attribute`) whose likelihoods order and fill the
    table. What the review cannot do is *widen*: it never introduces a pull
    request selection did not already implicate, and the only outcome it adds is
    withdrawal — a plan is dropped when no row is left standing at or above
    *min_score*. Within a plan it is a genuine second opinion, and an individual
    row's likelihood may come back higher than the first pass's as well as
    lower: that pass scored the row without ever seeing the other
    configurations, which is the deficiency this one exists to correct.

    **A configured review that does not answer produces no comment at all.**
    Not a fallback rendered from the first-pass scores — nothing. Two reasons,
    and the second is the load-bearing one:

    * The first pass asks the weaker question. It is enough to *select* a pull
      request; the whole premise of this stage is that a claim posted into
      someone else's repository deserves the cross-configuration reading too.
      An endpoint that is down is not a reason to lower that bar.
    * It makes comment quality **monotonic**, which nothing else here can. A
      degraded comment posted tonight and a reviewed comment rendered tomorrow
      rest on the *same* benchmark facts, so the digest is the same and
      :mod:`k4bench.blame.publish` would refuse the edit — the degraded body
      would stand forever, however many later reviews succeeded. Skipping the
      night instead means a standing comment is simply left alone and the next
      working review posts the real thing. A comment can therefore only ever
      improve: no review, then reviewed, and never back again.

    With no attributor configured at all the comment renders from the
    per-configuration scores, which is the whole of what this bot did before
    this stage existed and a coherent mode in its own right — every comment in
    it rests on the same evidence as every other.

    "Left standing" is the operative phrase in the withdrawal gate: it reads
    each row's *effective* likelihood, the review's score where it gave one and
    the per-configuration score where it did not. A partial reply is an accepted
    outcome (:func:`~k4bench.blame.attribute._parse_attribution`), so measuring
    withdrawal on the review's scores alone would let one low answer about one
    row acquit a pull request the review never disputed on the others.

    The rendered body carries nothing that varies from night to night (no run
    URL, no report-night query param): a regression that stands for a week is
    one comment, and the upsert must see unchanged *facts* so it edits nothing
    and re-notifies no one.

    The publisher edits a standing comment only when this changes
    (:func:`k4bench.blame.publish._upsert`), and an edit re-notifies everyone
    subscribed to the pull request. So the rule is two-sided, and both sides
    matter: a fact that changes what the comment claims must be in, and a number
    that moves on its own every night must be out.

    **In**: the window; every regression row's identity — platform included —
    and how far it moved; what the first pass knew about this pull request in
    each of those scopes; the clean and watch outcomes with their watched
    metrics and unjudged counts; the per-platform package diff and unchanged
    counts; which pull requests were in the field and whether each was judged;
    and whether the review's evidence — the subject's and competitors' diffs —
    could actually be fetched.

    The outcomes especially. A comment posted while IDEA had no reliable result
    reads differently once IDEA delivers a clean measurement of the same window
    — that control weakens the attribution and the review is shown it — and a
    digest covering only the positive rows would leave the old reasoning
    standing on the pull request forever, because nothing it hashed had moved.
    Diff availability is the same argument: a night where GitHub refused the
    patch produces a review made from paths and titles, and the night the fetch
    succeeds is a materially better-evidenced comment, not a reworded one.

    **Out**: the narrative, and every model score — the review's likelihoods and
    the ranker's scoring alike. Those drift between nights without anything
    having happened, and a competitor sliding from 84.4 to 84.6 is not worth
    re-notifying everyone watching a pull request. (Whether a candidate was
    scored *at all* is a different thing, and is in: it changes the table cell
    and the prompt from a percentage to "not scored".)

    **Also out, and less obviously so**: ``value``, ``baseline_median`` and
    ``z_score``. They are deterministic and they do reach the review's prompt,
    but they are *tonight's* measurement of a standing regression — the engine
    re-derives them from the latest run every night, so they move whenever the
    benchmark is re-run, which is nightly. Hashing them would edit every
    standing comment every night, which is the exact harm this digest exists to
    prevent. ``pct_change`` is the same kind of number and is included only at
    the precision the comment *displays* it (:func:`_canonical_pct`), so the
    digest changes when the visible table does and not before.

    Serialized as canonical JSON rather than joined strings so a field's value
    can never migrate into its neighbour's — ``a|b`` and ``a`` + ``|b`` hash
    alike, and identities here are user-supplied names.
