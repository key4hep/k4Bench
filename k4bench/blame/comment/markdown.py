    A PR title or a model's summary is untrusted text pasted into a comment the
    bot posts in someone else's repository. Left as-is it could:

    * ``@login`` — ping a person on every nightly edit (the same ban the whole
      bot honours by never rendering an author with an ``@``);
    * ``#123`` — cross-reference an unrelated issue, notifying its subscribers;
      a title like "Revert #45" carries one for free (:func:`_pr_ref` applies the
      same rule to the references this module writes itself, and the review is
      asked to name alternatives in exactly that form);
    * ``<!-- … -->`` / ``<tag>`` — hide following content, or inject markup;
    * ``[text](url)`` / ``![alt](url)`` — put an arbitrary clickable destination,
      or a remote image, into a comment the bot signs its own name to;
    * ``https://...`` / ``www....`` — GitHub autolinks a bare URL, so the prose
      needs no Markdown at all to become a link. A pull-request URL autolinked
      this way also cross-references that PR's timeline, which is the very
      notification :func:`_pr_ref` goes out of its way not to send.

    A zero-width space at each sequence's join breaks what GitHub would act on
    while leaving the text visually unchanged: after the trigger character for
    the prefix forms, and between ``]`` and ``(`` for a link, whose two halves
    are what make it one. Emphasis and backticks are deliberately left alone —
    they restyle the quoted text but cannot carry a reader anywhere. Table pipes
    are left to :func:`_cell`, which the cell paths still apply on top of this."""
