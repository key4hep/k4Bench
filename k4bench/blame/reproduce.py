"""Build the runnable benchmark recipe one blame comment links to.

The recipe is a standalone plain-text file (:func:`render_text`) published
beside the nightly data under a name derived from the measurement it
reproduces (:func:`artifact_name`), so the comment spends one table cell on a
link rather than dozens of lines on a fold-out shell script.

This module deliberately owns no I/O.  Callers fetch the two immutable
``run_info.json`` records (and, for legacy HepMC runs, may fill ``input_files``
from the checked-in benchmark config) before handing them to :func:`facts_from`,
and callers publish whatever :func:`render_text` returns.
