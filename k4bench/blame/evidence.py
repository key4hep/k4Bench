"""The evidence about a regression that is not a diff.

Both blame passes answer a causal question, and a diff on its own cannot answer
one. A change of +21% is only *evidence of a change* if the series it came out
of does not move 21% by itself; a pull request only *reaches* a regression if
the configurations that avoided the regression are ones its diff cannot reach;
and a step that lands exactly where the benchmark host changed, or across a
release boundary where no tracked package moved at all, has an explanation that
no pull request competes with.

This module owns those three kinds of evidence as data:

* :class:`MetricHistory` — the metric's own recent releases, with what the
  engine made of each, which machine produced it, and how much of the software
  stack moved entering it.
* :class:`ScopeOutcome` — the benchmark configurations that measured the same
  window and did *not* confirm a step: the negative evidence that bounds a
  cause's reach.
* the derived readings over both, so that "the step persisted", "this series
  trips every other release" and "the host changed here" are computed once,
  identically, for whichever pass is asking.

Nothing here renders anything (that is :mod:`k4bench.blame.prompt`) and nothing
here talks to a model. What it does own is the *meaning* of the evidence, so
that the per-configuration ranker and the cross-configuration reviewer cannot
quietly come to different readings of the same night.

    "IDEA did not move" point at different mechanisms. A configuration that did
    not run, failed, ran unreliably, stepped in this very window, or has not
    settled since a step of its own is *not* represented here at all: absence
    of evidence must never be rendered as evidence of absence.

    ``unjudged`` counts the metrics this configuration recorded but could not
    judge. Reported-only metrics are excluded because they duplicate another
    measurement and are never intended to be judged. The remaining metrics are
    not flat; they are unread, so the prompt states them. A configuration whose
    every metric is unjudged never becomes an outcome at all, and one with
    partial coverage is offered as the partial evidence it is.

    ``max_shift`` is how far this configuration's worst-displaced
    **non-confirming** judged metric sits from its own baseline, signed. A
    confirmed move outside the window does not disqualify the configuration as
    evidence about this window, but its percentage belongs to that other window
    and is deliberately excluded here. ``clean`` means nothing was flagged, and
    the engine only flags a move past
    :data:`~k4bench.regression.engine.EFFECT_FLOOR` (5% for a timing metric), so
    a configuration that moved 4.7% is ``clean`` and not flat. Without the number
    a page of them reads as a suite that held still — worst exactly when
    everything drifts together under the floor, which is when this evidence is
    weighed most. ``None`` when no judged metric has a finite relative shift.

    """The benchmark configurations that measured this window and did **not**

    "ALLEGRO moved and IDEA did not" is only readable if the *did not* is
    stated, and so is the sharper within-detector version — "baseline moved and
    no_HCAL did not" — which is why a configuration, not a run group, is the
    unit here. Excluding a whole group because one of its configurations
    regressed would delete exactly the control the prompt asks the model to reason
    from: the baseline that stepped and the detector-removal run that did not live
    in the *same* group.

    A configuration counts only when it genuinely produced a clean measurement to
    compare against — it ran one of *stacks* (the releases the regressed rows were
    measured on), its host was judged reliable, its group had no job failure, it
    recorded no metric failure of its own, it neither confirmed a step inside this
    window nor is still settling onto a step of its own
    (:func:`disqualified_as_control`), and at least one of its metrics could
    actually be judged. Everything else is silence from a run that did not
    happen or cannot be read, and silence
    must never be rendered as evidence of absence: ``reliable is None`` means *no
    evidence either way*, so it is treated like an unreliable run rather than like
    a clean one, and an unjudged metric (``UNKNOWN``) is unread rather than flat
    — it never contributes to the clean verdict. Non-duplicate unjudged metrics
    are counted onto the outcome so the prompt can state the coverage gap.

    *regressed_scopes* only orders the result: the like-for-like controls — same
    detector, same sample, same platform as something that did regress — come
