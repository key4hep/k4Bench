"""Talk to GitHub: resolve a repo's commit range to the pull requests that
landed in it, and read/write the comments :mod:`k4bench.blame.publish` posts on
those pull requests.

The one network-touching module in :mod:`k4bench.blame`. It runs in CI, in the
nightly ``regression-report`` job, *after* the report is built and uploaded — so
its failures are contained to a missing ``blame.json``, never a missing report.

Everything here degrades rather than raises, with one deliberate exception: a
GitHub **rate limit** raises :class:`RateLimitError`, because past that point no
further repo can be resolved and the builder should stop and keep what it has
rather than hammer a throttled API. A 404 (``develop`` force-pushed, base commit
gone), the 250-commit compare cap, and a non-GitHub host are all normal outcomes
recorded on the result, not errors.

Auth is a ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` (5000 req/hr; a regression touches ~15 repos, so a
night is tens of calls). Without one the public limit is 60/hr and will throttle
almost immediately — the builder treats the token as effectively required and
simply produces diffs without candidates when it is missing. The comment
endpoints need a *different*, write-scoped token — see :class:`GitHubClient`.

    Every page of ``/pulls/{n}/files`` (up to :data:`_MAX_FILE_PAGES`) carries
    both the paths the ranker keys on — persisted on the
    :class:`CandidatePR` — and each file's ``patch`` hunk, which is kept for the
    transient diff sample (:func:`diff_sample`). The PR metadata's ``changed_files`` count
    is the completeness check; when older/malformed metadata lacks it, a short
    final page is the fallback proof. A failed page, a count mismatch, or the
    page cap returns ``files_complete=False`` so the enclosing resolution is
    disclosed as truncated and ranking is skipped.

    Complete paths are always kept (cheap, high-signal); each hunk is kept up to
    :data:`_STORED_PATCH_CHARS`. Binary files and pure renames carry no
    ``patch``, so they contribute their path but no hunk.

    The sample's budget is spent in *relevance* order, not in GitHub's order
    (see :func:`diff_sample`). The paths keep the order GitHub gave them — they
    are the pull request's own shape and cheap enough to keep whole — but the
    hunks do not: a change touching a lockfile, a changelog and one source file
    spends its whole allowance on the first two if the order is left alone, and
    what reaches the model is then a diff with no code in it. On a wide window,
    where each pull request gets barely a kilobyte, that is the difference
