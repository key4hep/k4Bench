"""Diff two Key4hep stacks — which packages moved, and to what.

The unit of comparison is the **release** (the nightly tag), not the day a
benchmark ran. The nightly build lags: on a day with no new nightly the
benchmark sources the newest one available, so several consecutive run dates
routinely share one identical stack. Comparing run dates would invent changes
that never happened.

That makes the *empty* diff as informative as a full one. Two nights that share
a stack cannot differ by an upstream commit, so a metric that stepped between
them moved for some other reason — the host, the sample, or noise. Callers are
expected to say so rather than present an empty list as "nothing found".
